# FancyTextRendering

It's some code to render markdown & clickable links in Unity. How fun!

## We got multiple levels of headers

Isn't that neat.

Anywho, we've got all your standard Markdown features. You can make stuff *italic* or **bold**, or even ***both simultaneously***. You can cross out stuff with ~~strikethrough~~ or make it codey with `monospace`.

### Lists!

Boy oh boy do we have lissefas

aaaaaa
